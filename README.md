## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a longtime developer and technical writer whoâ€™s been building and breaking things on the web since the mid-'90s. Back in the day, I ran PageResource.com and JavaScriptCity.com, which aimed to help folks get started with web development for free.

Iâ€™ve written a couple of programming booksâ€”JavaScript: A Beginner's Guide and jQuery: A Beginner's Guideâ€”and spent time coding and writing for both the state government and a medical software company.

These days I work mostly with what some call the WENP stack (though there doesn't appear to be an established name for it at this time): Windows, Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. 

Overall, I have experience with:

* JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Perl, PHP, Python
* Node.js, Express
* MySQL, PostgreSQL
* Apache, Windows, Linux
* Technical Writing (mainly instructions, documentation, and user manuals)

Always up for solving problems, learning something new, or revisiting old-school tech with fresh eyes. If you're into clean code, clear docs, or just geeking out over web history, weâ€™ll probably get along!
